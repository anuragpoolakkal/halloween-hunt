# Pygame | Bit Lords
Pygame project by Bit Lords developed on Proxy22.

We developed a halloween themed survival game which has three levels. The player will be promoted to second and final levels after succesfully completeing previous levels. After completing all three levels, player will win the game.

W, A, S and D can be used for navigation. Press SPACE to jump. Enemies will be falling from the sky and the player should try to avoid contact with enemy. Whenever the player got contacted to enemy, he'll loose a life. After loosing three lives, the game will be resetted.

Music is added to improve in-game experience. 

Developing the game was a challenging and entertaining task and we learnt a lot from the 12 hours of development.
