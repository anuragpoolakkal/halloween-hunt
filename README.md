# Halloween Hunt
Pygame project by Bit Lords developed on Proxy22.

We developed a halloween themed survival game which has three levels. The player will be promoted to second and final levels after succesfully completeing previous levels. After completing all three levels, player will win the game.

The game has a main menu with "Start" and "Quit" oprions. Press "Start" to play the game.

Arrow keys can be used for navigation. Press SPACE to jump. Enemies will be falling from the sky and the player should try to avoid contact with enemy. Whenever the player got contacted to enemy, he'll loose a life. After loosing three lives, the game will be resetted.

The player wins points on catching pumpkins and can get promoted to level 2 by winning 5 points. Level 2 will be harder and may needs more effort and concentration to pass. WInning 10 points in level 2 can promote the player to level 3, the final one and hardest of all. Hard earned 15 points is needed to win the final level and to become the Champion!

Music and sound effects are added to improve in-game experience. 

Developing the game was a challenging and entertaining task and we learnt a lot from the 12 hours of development. We're planning to make further progress in this project.

To run this project:
```
 python ./game.py
